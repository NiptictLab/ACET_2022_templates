\section{General Instructions}

The paper size of final proceedings printing is A4 paper (210mm by
297mm).

Print all text, including section titles and figures, in two-column
format where each column is 7.5cm by 23.7cm and there is a 1.0cm space
between the two columns.  Exceptions to the two-column format include
the title at the top of the first page and any full-width figures or
tables.  Start all pages directly under the top margin.  Text should be
centered on each page.  On A4 paper, this roughly means leaving 2.5cm
margins on left and right sides of each page as well as a 3.0cm margin
on the top of each page.

Type single spaced.  Indent when starting a new paragraph.  Use Times
Roman font with 11 points for text, 12 points for subsection headings,
13 points for section headings and 15 points for title.

\subsection{Pages for submiussion}

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages), so that reviewersâ€™ comments can be taken into account.

\subsection{Electronically-available resources}

This file along with the \LaTeX{} style file and the bibliography style
file are available at \url{https://github.com/NiptictLab/ACET_2022_templates/tree/main/paper}.  The
Microsoft Word template file is also present at the same URL.  We
strongly recommend the use of these style files, that have been
appropriately tailored for the ACET 2022 camera-ready manuscript.

\subsection{Title, authors' names and affiliations}

Place the title at the top of the first page, followed by the authors'
names and their affiliations.  Long title should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening.  The title of the paper should be
writen in bold in 14 point font.  The first letter of word except
preposition (i.e., of, with, on, in, for), definite article (the) and
indefinite article (a, an) in the title should be capitalized.  The
authors name' must be in bold in 12 point font, followed the title with
a line space skipped.  The affiliation should followed the authors name,
in 12 point font.

Center the title across both columns.  Use the two-column format only
when you begin the abstract.  Note for \LaTeX{}, use \verb+\and+ to
separate authors from the same affiliation, and \verb+\AND+ for starting
an author block in the separated line.

\subsection{Abstract and keywords}

Type the abstract at the beginning of the first column.  Center the word
{\bf Abstract} in 11 point bold font above the body of the abstract.
Use 11 point font for the body of abstract.  Every paper should include
an abstract with 150-300 words.  

At the end of the abstract, skip a line and then type ``Keywords:''
(11pt bold and followed by a colon) followed by up to five (5) words
that describe the focus and contribution of the paper.

\subsection{Text}

Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after the keywords
with 11 point font, observing the two-column format as shown in this
example.

\subsection{Section headings}

Type and label section headings in 12pt bold font.  Use numbered
sections, in order to facilitate cross references.

\subsection{Subsection headings}

Type and label section headings in 11pt bold font.  Use numbered
sections, in order to facilitate cross references.

\subsection{Font styles}

{\bf References}: Citations within the text appear in bracket as
[Number] such as \cite{ACM:83}, \cite{APA}, \cite{Vichet_2015}, \cite{Ye_KhmerSMT_2015} and \cite{Ye_KhmerPOS_2017}.  Gather the full set of references together under the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any {\bf Appendices}, unless they contain references. Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format.

{\bf Appendixes}: Appendixes, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the paper
near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.  See
\figref{sampleimg} for include an illustration.

\end{center}
\end{figure} 

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each
one sequentially in the form: ``Figure 1:  Caption of the Figure.''
``Table 1:  Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions for figures below
the figures.  Type the captions for tables above the tables (see
\figref{fontstyle}).


\section{Style of Camera-Ready Manuscript}

All illustrations, references, and appendices must be accommodated within these page limits, also observing the formatting instructions given in the present document.  {\bf Note that DO NOT put a page number in each page.}
